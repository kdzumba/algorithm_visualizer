# algorithm_visualizer

This is a desktop application for visualizing different path finding and search algorithms on a Graph, motivated by Clement Mihailescu's path finding visualizer, which can be found at https://clementmihailescu.github.io/Pathfinding-Visualizer/#. The application is written in Java, the language I am currently learning at the time of initial development, and is meant to serve as my practice into the language's fundamentals.
